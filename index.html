  review: I had a great experience working with Elyse. She was so prompt and helpful. She did a beautiful painting of my in-laws home for a wedding gift for my nephew. It is so meaningful and I know it will be cherished for years to come!

  review: Elyse created a beautiful portrait of my friend's childhood home. I know he will love it! She was wonderful to work with. Great communication and suggestions to make this painting better than I had imagined. She was very friendly and welcoming with any requests for details that I had. I would definitely recommend Elyse and will order from her again in the future! Thank you, Elyse!

  review: Elyse did an amazing job with 2 house portrait watercolors I ordered! love them!!

  review: Elyse was amazing! Responded within minutes to my request and had the painting completed within 48 hours!! My siblings and I gave this to our parents for their 30th anniversary, and they absolutely loved it!

  review: If I could give this shop owner 1,000,000 stars, I would. First and foremost, her customer service is top notch! We had a small issue (my fault 100%) and she solved it at no extra cost. Second, her product was beautiful. Third, the recipients of this gift cried when they saw it. They were truly shocked at how someone would be able to capture the magic of their home without ever seeing it.

  review: She did such an amazing job with a pet portrait. Used as a wedding gift and my sister absolutely loved it! Highly recommend; sheâ€™s efficient and extremely flexible.
